# CLAUDE.md

Self-hosted fitness & health data platform. Garmin + Strava in, one owned SQLite+Parquet
archive, a REST/JSON API an AI agent can write notes through, a fast web frontend. Runs on a
Synology DS1019+ (Celeron J3455, no AVX/AVX2, 8GB RAM) behind an existing reverse proxy;
developed on Windows + Podman Desktop. The NAS itself runs Docker (DSM Container Manager) —
the engine swap is dev-only, see `docs/adr/0001-phase-0-foundations.md` decision 8.

**Current phase: 7 (map explorer, recaps, PWA/offline shell — see
`docs/adr/0011-phase-7-map-recaps-pwa.md`; image export was scoped in but dropped after
verification showed the chosen library hangs on this app's Recharts-heavy pages, and PWA
service-worker registration itself still needs verification on a real device, not just the
build/manifest checks done so far). Phase 6.1 (frontend design overhaul — theming, Recharts,
colour/icon system, calendar date-navigator, rich activity cards, multi-panel activity detail,
day view, bounded activity-context enrichment), Phase 6 (calendar grid, weekly/monthly rollups,
Fitness & Form, health dashboard), Phase 5 (core dashboard frontend + per-athlete auth), Phase 4
(MCP server exposing the read API + notes), Phase 3 (read API, precomputed rollups, DuckDB,
notes write path), and Phase 2 (garmin_export/garmin_connect adapters, scheduler, staleness,
health/wellness ingestion, real-export nested-zip discovery) are complete.**
See the phase table in the project brief (kept outside this repo) for the full 10-phase plan.
Do not skip ahead — each phase has its own ADR in `docs/adr/` and its own acceptance criterion.

## The one rule that overrides everything else

**Raw first, always.** Every byte fetched from any vendor is archived verbatim — original
FIT/TCX/GPX bytes, and the raw JSON of every HTTP response with request URL, timestamp,
status, and SHA-256 — *before* it is parsed. Parsing is a pure function over that archive. If
we discover a field we ignored today, we must be able to re-derive the entire database from
the archive **without re-contacting any vendor**. And: **never drop an unknown field.**
Unmapped FIT fields and unmapped JSON keys get auto-registered into `metric_definition`, not
discarded. If you're writing an adapter or a parser and you're about to throw away a field
because you don't recognize it — stop, that's the bug.

## Non-negotiable principles (§3 of the project brief)

1. Raw first, always — see above.
2. Never drop an unknown field — see above.
3. **Idempotent, re-runnable ingestion.** Running any sync twice is a no-op. Content hashing
   plus upserts, never blind inserts.
4. **Provenance per field, not per record.** Every stored value knows its source and when.
5. **Never destructive.** No migration or sync deletes raw data. Soft-delete only.
6. **SI units in storage** (metres, seconds, m/s, kg, °C, W, bpm), converted at the
   presentation layer. Timestamps: UTC + local UTC offset + IANA timezone name.
   **Implementation note**: every `DateTime` column is a *naive* Python datetime that's
   implicitly UTC — SQLite/SQLAlchemy don't actually round-trip `tzinfo`, so declaring
   `timezone=True` would be a lie (see `docs/adr/0002-phase-1-schema-and-ingestion.md`
   decision 10, and `docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md`). Never assume a value read from the DB is
   timezone-aware.
7. **Additive schema evolution.** A new activity type or health metric needs zero migrations
   and zero code changes — only a registry row.

## Architecture

- **Bronze/raw archive** (`data/raw/`, table `raw_object`): every vendor HTTP response and
  every FIT/TCX/GPX file, gzipped, content-addressed at `<sha256[:2]>/<sha256>.gz`, immutable.
  Each blob has a JSON sidecar (`<sha256>.json`) mirroring its `raw_object` row — the sidecar,
  not the SQLite row, is the durable catalog; `sync rebuild` restores `raw_object` from
  sidecars first, which is what makes rebuilding after deleting the database entirely work.
- **SQLite (WAL mode)**: metadata, daily/summary health observations, activity summaries,
  laps/splits, rollups, notes. What you filter and join on. See `docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` for
  the full table list.
- **Parquet, one file per activity** (`data/parquet/<athlete_id>/<activity_id>.parquet`):
  full-resolution per-second activity streams. What you plot. Never rows-in-SQLite for this.
  Downsampling into `low`/`medium`/`high` tiers happens at serving time
  (`stream_query.py::downsample`, one DuckDB bucket-averaging SQL statement against the
  Parquet file — never ingestion-time, never a Python loop).
- **DuckDB**, attached read-only over the SQLite database (`api/duckdb_conn.py`), for the one
  query that actually benefits from it: `GET /activities/{id}/stream`. Everything else in the
  read API (activity list/detail, health, sleep, the rollup-backed calendar) stays on plain
  SQLAlchemy — DuckDB isn't a general query-builder abstraction here. See
  `docs/adr/0006-phase-3-read-api-and-rollups.md`.
- **MCP server** (`api/mcp_server.py`), mounted at `/mcp` inside the same `api`
  container/process, not a separate service — a deliberate, informed deviation from an early
  Phase-0 guess, made once Streamable HTTP's actual shape (a plain mountable ASGI app) was
  known. Eight tools, one per REST endpoint above plus `create_note`/`list_notes`; each tool
  calls its REST endpoint in-process via `httpx.ASGITransport`, reusing the REST layer's logic
  rather than a second implementation. Gated by the same `X-API-Key` via a raw ASGI wrapper
  (`Mount` bypasses FastAPI's own `Depends`). `mcp>=1.9,<2` — 2.x just went stable and isn't
  adopted yet. See `docs/adr/0007-phase-4-mcp-server.md`.
- **Per-athlete auth (Phase 5)**: `require_api_key` (`api/dependencies.py`) resolves — not just
  gates — the authenticated `athlete_id` from any of three credentials: the legacy shared
  `SPORTHEALTH_API_KEY` (→ `DEFAULT_ATHLETE_ID`, so the MCP server and existing scripts keep
  working unchanged), a per-athlete `X-API-Key` (SHA-256-hashed, `athlete.api_key_hash`), or an
  `Authorization: Bearer` JWT issued by `POST /auth/login` (password checked via stdlib
  PBKDF2, `auth/passwords.py`; signed with `SPORTHEALTH_JWT_SECRET`, `auth/tokens.py`). Every
  router query is scoped to the resolved athlete, not a hardcoded default. Provisioned via
  `sync athlete set-password`/`create-key` — CLI-only, no self-service signup. See
  `docs/adr/0008-phase-5-frontend.md`.
- **Frontend** (`frontend/src/`): Vite + React 19 + TS-strict, `wouter` for routing,
  `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching, a hand-rolled SVG chart (no charting library) for
  the one stream-chart need. The API base URL is runtime-configured
  (`frontend/public/config.js`, regenerated at container start from
  `SPORTHEALTH_API_BASE_URL` via nginx's own `docker-entrypoint.d` mechanism) — never baked
  into the Vite build, since the reverse-proxy hostname doesn't resolve the same way inside vs.
  outside the house (double-NAT/split-horizon DNS, see `docs/DEPLOY.md`). `AuthGate` offers
  either credential path (password or a pasted API key); a background 401 clears the stored
  credential and re-prompts automatically.
- **Weekly/monthly rollups + Fitness & Form (Phase 6)**: `period_rollup`/
  `health_metric_period_rollup` are a rollup OF `day_rollup`/`health_metric_daily_rollup`
  (sum-of-sums, weighted averages), not of raw tables — `period_type` (`"week"`|`"month"`)
  discriminated rather than four separate tables. Week starts Monday. `fitness_daily_rollup`
  stores an independently-computed Coggan/Banister CTL(42d)/ATL(7d)/TSB EWMA over daily
  `fit.session.training_load_peak` — Garmin's own exports have no CTL/ATL/TSB at all, so the
  frontend shows this alongside (not reconciled against) Garmin's own Training Readiness/Status.
  Full history recompute on every relevant ingest run (`fitness.py::refresh_fitness_rollup`),
  not incremental — cheap even at ~1,400+ days, and a retroactive correction invalidates
  everything forward from it regardless of scheme. `GET /health/dashboard` merges the same
  logical field's several raw `metric_key` namespaces (`api/routers/health.py::
  LOGICAL_METRICS`, verified field-by-field against the real database, not assumed from parser
  docstrings). See `docs/adr/0009-phase-6-calendar-rollups-fitness-health.md`.
- **Adapters** implement one `SourceAdapter` protocol (`health_check`, `authenticate`,
  `list_changed`, `fetch_raw`, `parse` — see `adapters/base.py`). Three exist now:
  - `fit_folder` (`adapters/fit_folder.py`) — polling directory importer, content-hash
    idempotent. The universal offline importer/test harness for every other adapter. Also
    recognizes two narrow Garmin Connect-shaped health JSON filename patterns
    (`daily_summary_*.json`, `hydration_*.json`) — not a general JSON importer.
  - `garmin_export` (`adapters/garmin_export.py`) — historical backfill from a Garmin "Export
    Your Data" archive (directory or `.zip`), zero network calls. Recursively finds FIT files
    at any depth, including nested inside further `.zip` files — confirmed necessary against a
    real export, whose FIT files (activity and health mixed together) all live one zip-level
    deeper than the top-level archive; see `docs/adr/0005-phase-2-garmin-export-real-data.md`.
    Health JSON under `DI-Connect-Wellness`/`Metrics`/`Aggregator` is parsed generically
    (`garmin.export.<report_kind>.<field>`, one parser for all ~24 report kinds, not bespoke
    code per kind — ADR 0005). Everything else (account data, bulk activity summaries, and
    unrelated non-fitness product domains a Garmin account's export can bundle) is archived
    raw but not parsed.
  - `garmin_connect` (`adapters/garmin_connect.py`) — the primary, incremental, unattended
    sync path, and the adapter most likely to break. See the safety rules below before
    touching this file.
  Every `.fit` file, from any adapter (except `garmin_connect`, which only ever downloads
  activity FIT files), goes through `ingest_dispatch.ingest_fit_bytes` — archives once, tries
  the shared activity parser (`fit/parser.py`), falls back to the shared health parser
  (`health/fit_parser.py`) if it isn't an activity. No adapter has its own parser. See
  `docs/adr/0004-phase-2-health-ingestion.md`.
  When a vendor breaks — and Garmin already has, twice, as of this writing — the fix is
  confined to one adapter file. If fixing a vendor break means touching the schema, the design
  is wrong; stop and say so.
- **`garmin_connect` safety rules, non-negotiable**: it never constructs a credentialed client
  automatically — `authenticate()` only loads the token store (`data/garmin_tokens/`), and if
  that fails, raises `GarminAuthRequired` rather than falling back to credentials. The *only*
  place credentials are ever used is `sync auth login`, run interactively by a human. A 429
  (`GarminConnectTooManyRequestsError`) aborts the current run immediately — no retry, ever,
  anywhere. Garmin's SSO 429-locks per account with no recovery path; see
  `docs/adr/0003-phase-2-garmin-adapters.md` for how this is enforced structurally, not just
  by convention.
- **Staleness is a first-class signal, not an afterthought.** `sporthealth/staleness.py` checks
  (a) whether `garmin_connect` has succeeded recently — escalating from "warning" to "critical"
  past `SPORTHEALTH_GARMIN_STALE_ESCALATE_DAYS` (default 7) — and (b) whether
  `athlete.last_full_export_at` is fresh enough (`SPORTHEALTH_EXPORT_FRESHNESS_DAYS`, default
  90). Both fire a generic JSON webhook (`SPORTHEALTH_STALENESS_WEBHOOK_URL`) if configured.
  The worker container (`worker/main.py`, APScheduler) runs `garmin_connect` sync + this check
  daily (default 04:15 local, jittered); `garmin_export` is never scheduled, it's a manual
  CLI action.
- **Never drop a field, concretely**: the activity FIT parser (`fit/parser.py`), health FIT
  parser (`health/fit_parser.py`), and health JSON parser (`health/json_parser.py`) all
  register every field they see into `metric_definition`, even ones they don't materialize a
  value for (a field on a known message/object they don't map to a column, or a field of an
  entirely unrecognized message type/nested JSON structure). See each module's docstring for
  exactly which fields get values stored where versus cataloged-only.
- Multi-tenant from day one: every data table carries `athlete_id` except `athlete` and
  `metric_definition` (shared catalogs, not personal data) — enforced by a schema test
  (`tests/db/test_schema.py`), not just convention. Only one athlete row exists today.

## Platform constraints that shape every decision

- **DS1019+ / Celeron J3455 (Goldmont): no AVX, no AVX2, only up to SSE4.2.** Anything built
  for x86-64-v3 illegal-instruction-crashes on the NAS. Native builds are capped at
  x86-64-v2; numpy/pyarrow/duckdb ship wheels that runtime-dispatch. CI runs an AVX-masked
  (QEMU `Westmere` CPU model — SSE4.2 + AES-NI, no AVX, matching Goldmont; the generic
  `qemu64` model tried first turned out to lack even SSE4.1/SSE4.2, a stricter and
  non-representative baseline that false-positived on every push) import smoke test
  specifically to catch this before it reaches the NAS.
- **8GB RAM total, shared with DSM.** Whole stack budgeted at ~1.5GB. uvicorn runs 2 workers,
  not `cpu_count()`. This is also why SQLite, not Postgres.
- **Never build on the NAS.** Images are built on Windows or in CI, pushed to GHCR, pulled by
  the DS1019+'s Container Manager.
- **Precomputed rollups are mandatory.** The Celeron cannot aggregate a decade of activities
  per request — every dashboard/calendar/recap view reads a `*_rollup` table (`day_rollup`,
  `health_metric_daily_rollup`, `rollups.py`) refreshed on ingest, never scans at request time.
  Every ingest entry point (`fit_folder`, `garmin_export`, `garmin_connect`, `rebuild`)
  accumulates which `local_date`s it touched and calls `refresh_daily_rollup` once per
  distinct date after its loop — bounded by dates touched, not files processed. A future
  adapter must honor this same contract. See `docs/adr/0006-phase-3-read-api-and-rollups.md`.
- **Windows dev, Linux prod.** LF enforced via `.gitattributes`. `pathlib` everywhere. The
  `fit_folder` watcher polls (no reliance on inotify — SMB/rsync-written files don't reliably
  fire inotify events inside a container).

## When a vendor library breaks

It will. `python-garminconnect` has already been rebuilt once (garth → curl_cffi) as of this
writing. The contract: **the fix stays inside one adapter file.** If you find yourself
changing the schema, the API contract, or the frontend because a vendor changed a JSON key,
stop — that's a sign the abstraction leaked, not a sign the schema was wrong.

**Verify a vendor library's API by introspecting the installed package, not from memory.**
`docs/adr/0003-phase-2-garmin-adapters.md` decision 1-2 is the example: introspecting
`garminconnect`'s actual `login()` source (not recalling its shape) surfaced a real
credential-fallback behavior that directly shaped the auth-safety design. Training data on
fast-moving vendor libraries is exactly what this project's brief warns is stale.
