# Data Dictionary

The source of truth for what every stored field means, its unit, and where it came from.
Grows every phase — updated at the end of each phase alongside `CLAUDE.md`, per the project's
"ways of working" rule.

## Conventions

- All physical quantities stored in SI units: metres, seconds, m/s, kg, °C, W, bpm. Conversion
  to imperial/display units happens at the presentation layer only, never in storage.
- **All datetime columns are naive Python `datetime` values that are implicitly UTC** — never
  timezone-aware. This is deliberate: SQLite/SQLAlchemy do not actually round-trip `tzinfo`
  through `DateTime(timezone=True)` (a value written as aware UTC comes back naive on read),
  so declaring `timezone=True` would advertise a guarantee the backend can't keep. See
  `docs/adr/0002-phase-1-schema-and-ingestion.md` decision 10. `activity.utc_offset_s` carries
  the local UTC offset in seconds separately, so "what time was it there" stays recoverable;
  `tz_name` (IANA zone name) is reserved but not yet populated — FIT files don't carry it
  directly, and deriving it from GPS coordinates is a deferred enhancement.
- Every `metric_definition` row records `first_seen_at` and `first_seen_source` — provenance
  isn't just per-value, it's per-metric-existing-at-all.
- Position (lat/lon) is stored as decimal degrees, converted from FIT's native semicircle
  integer format (`degrees = semicircles * (180 / 2**31)`) at parse time.

## Tables

### Bronze

- **`raw_object`** — one row per archived blob (gzip-compressed at `storage_path`,
  content-addressed by `sha256`, unique per `(athlete_id, sha256)`). Also mirrored as a JSON
  sidecar next to the blob on disk (`<sha256>.json`) — the sidecar, not this row, is the
  actual durable catalog; `sync rebuild` restores this table from sidecars first if the
  database was deleted entirely. `source_locator` is a file path (file-based adapters like
  `fit_folder`) or an HTTP URL (future API-based adapters); `kind` is adapter-defined
  (`fit_activity` for now).

### Core

- **`athlete`** — single row today (multi-tenancy scaffolding for a possible future).
- **`device`** — one row per distinct `(manufacturer, product, serial_number)` seen in a FIT
  file's `file_id` message. `product` prefers the SDK's friendly name (e.g. `"fr955"`) over
  the raw numeric product code.
- **`activity`** — one row per real-world activity (post-merge; see `activity_source_link`).
  `id` is a ULID, not an autoincrement int, so it's sortable and safe to expose externally
  later without leaking row counts. `primary_source` records which adapter's data currently
  populates the core fields (field-level provenance/override precedence is a later-phase
  concern).
- **`activity_source_link`** — links one `activity` to every raw file/record that contributes
  to it. `external_id` is the adapter's idempotency key — for `fit_folder`, derived from the
  FIT file's device serial + start time (falling back to the file's sha256), deliberately
  never the filename, since real device folders don't use descriptive names.
- **`activity_metric`** — open-ended per-activity facts with no dedicated column, keyed
  `fit.<message>.<field>` (e.g. `fit.session.total_grit`, `fit.lap.27` for an unnamed FIT
  field number). This is what makes a new watch's extra fields show up without a migration.
- **`activity_stream`** — one row per activity referencing its full-resolution Parquet file
  (`channels` is a JSON list of whichever of `heart_rate`, `cadence`, `power`, `temperature`,
  `speed_mps`, `altitude_m`, `respiration_rate`, `distance_m`, `lat`, `lon` the FIT record
  messages actually carried — not every activity has every channel).
- **`lap`**, **`split`** — structured enough to earn real columns rather than living in
  `activity_metric`. `split` is populated from FIT `split_mesgs` when present (auto-laps,
  intervals) — not exclusively swim `length` messages as originally sketched.
- **`route_geom`** — `encoded_polyline`/`simplified_polyline` are identical for now (real
  Douglas-Peucker simplification is deferred to Phase 7, the map explorer). Falls back to
  session-level start/end/bbox fields when an activity has no per-record GPS (e.g. indoor).

### Health (schema only as of Phase 1 — population starts Phase 2)

- **`health_observation`**, **`health_stream`**, **`sleep_session`**, **`sleep_stage`** —
  defined now for additive schema evolution; no FIT monitoring/sleep files were part of
  Phase 1's real test data, so these aren't populated yet.

### Registries (exempt from athlete-scoping — shared catalogs, not personal data)

- **`metric_definition`** — the metric catalog. `metric_key` is the natural primary key.
  `category` is `activity | health | device | unknown`; `unknown` means a field was seen but
  its meaning hasn't been promoted/documented yet (`is_promoted`). Comprehensive by
  construction: every field the FIT parser sees, named or not, gets an entry here — see the
  parser's module docstring for exactly which are materialized as values versus cataloged only.

### Ops

- **`ingest_run`** — one row per adapter invocation (`sync import fit-folder ...`), tracking
  `items_seen`/`items_new`/`errors` (JSON). Same shape Phase 2's scheduler reuses.
- **`merge_decision`** — one row per activity-ingest attempt, logging whether it matched an
  existing activity or became a new one, with the full `MergeDecision.reasons`/`inputs` for
  audit. Written even for `fit_folder` alone (catches duplicate files within one source), not
  just once a second source exists.

## Metric registry

Populated automatically by `sporthealth.metrics.registry.get_or_register_metric`, called from
the FIT parser's ingest path for every field it encounters. As of the Phase 1 acceptance run
(776 real activity FIT files), 824 distinct metric keys were cataloged. Browse the live catalog
via `select * from metric_definition` — there is no separate promoted-metrics document yet
(Phase 3's `/metrics` endpoint and the frontend's metric registry browser, Phase 5+, are the
intended long-term ways to browse this).
